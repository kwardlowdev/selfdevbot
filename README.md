# Self Development Bot
 A simple, static site with randomized content and a small js string parser that uses a sort of adlib style markup code.

## Background

 My name is Kyle Wardlow, and I have and continue to deal with the stresses and trials associated with adult ADHD and anxiety/depression. As such, I wanted to build something for my first portfolio project that would address some of the things in life that trouble me. I hope this project will allow me to reinforce the affirmations and personal reminders that I, and perhaps many others, need to hear.

## Current Features
+ Randomized set of affirmation words.
+ Randomized reminder for those of us who deal with anxiety and stress.
+ Randomized joke quote with random attribution.
+ Individual section randomizers.
