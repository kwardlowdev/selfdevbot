# Self Development Bot
 This project is being coded for Codecademy's Mixed Message Generator Project

## Background

 My name is Kyle Wardlow, and I have and continue to deal with the stresses and trials associated with adult ADHD and anxiety/depression. As such, I wanted to build something for my first "for real portfolio project" that would address some of the things in life that trouble me. I hope this project will allow me to reinforce the affirmations and personal reminders that I, and perhaps many others, need to hear.

## Planned Features
+ Random affirmation.
+ Random reminder.
+ Randomized joke inspirational quote.

## Scope & Potential Future

 While I have learned quite a lot so far from this career path, I haven't yet learned a lot of back-end work. As such, storage of the components for messages will be less than perhaps would be ideal, and manipulation/user interactivity will be nil.

 I hope to implement in the future:

 + Alternative storage methods.
 + On-site ability to interact with and manipulate the available data for messages.
 + User-specific data sets.
 + Inspirational Joke Poster Generation.
